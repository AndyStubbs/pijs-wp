## **Key Features**

### **1. Interactive Code Editor**
The website integrates the **Monaco Editor** for browser-based coding with Pi.js. This editor is available in two modes:

- **Simple Editor**:
	- Enables users to write and execute single-file projects with Pi.js embedded.
	- Automatically includes boilerplate HTML and CSS, so users can focus solely on JavaScript.

- **Advanced Editor**:
	- Allows users to upload assets such as images, sound files, and additional JavaScript files to build more complex projects.
	- Runs all code securely in a popup window hosted on a separate domain for sanitization.
	- HTML and CSS editing is not supported, as these are auto-generated to align with the library's structure.
